Welcome to my first blog post!

In this post, I want to show how easy it is to share knowledge and publish blog entries using my new website.

## Why a Personal Knowledge Base?

- Centralizes notes, tutorials, and code snippets.
- Easy to search and organize.
- Accessible from anywhere.

## How I Publish a New Post

1. Add a new markdown file in the `_posts` directory.
2. The file name follows the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
3. Add a front matter block at the top (as you see here).
4. Write your content using simple [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
5. Commit and push!

That’s it — GitHub Pages publishes it automatically.
